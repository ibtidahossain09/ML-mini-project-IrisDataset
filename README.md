# 🌸 Iris Dataset Classification Project

This project demonstrates a basic machine learning workflow using the famous Iris flower dataset. The goal is to classify the species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Untitled1.ipynb`: Main Colab notebook with data loading, visualization, and model training.
- `Iris.csv`: The dataset used for training and evaluation.

## 📊 Features Used

- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

## 🔍 Models Applied

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 📈 Visualizations

- 2D scatter plot by species
- 3D scatter plot using petal and sepal features
- Confusion matrix heatmap
